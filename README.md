# Dream Journal App

## Introduction:
What it does:
- tracks dream journal entries
- logs hours of sleep

The Dream Cabin is a place to log down all your dreams, as we often quickly forget them upon waking up. This application features a submission form, complete with an entry field and a dropdown menu to list the hours of sleep for that night.

## Unsolved Problems:
- Needs better styling, it's purely functional at this point

## Future Enhancements:

## Biggest Challenges
- frontend update function was SUPER difficult
- Front end routing is hard.
- Deploying the frontend was difficult due to casing issue.
- React is hard. period.

## Biggest Takeaways
- I finally understand how the front end fetches data from the backend on a conceptual level
- I am finally feeling more confident when it comes to CSS positioning using Flexbox.
